# CalmDefault

My first angular 2 app. This app was built as I follow along in [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/) [Angular 2 course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/overview). It will change significantly as I learn about new features and techniques within Angular2.

Calm Default will provide an alternate method for discovering related videos on YouTube. I often find YouTube suggestions are so similar that I have a hard time finding variety. Calm Default will be a project to use the videos "Liked" by channels you follow to create a playlist of related videos with a better breadth of diversity.
